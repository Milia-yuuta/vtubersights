      <h2>What Are VTubers?</h2>
      <p>
        VTubers, or Virtual YouTubers, are online content creators who use virtual avatars instead of showing their real faces. These digital personas can range from anime-inspired characters to more unique designs, and they create content across platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The VTuber phenomenon began in Japan but has since expanded globally, with creators and agencies emerging worldwide. VTubers create diverse content including gaming streams, music performances, art creation, educational content, and much more.
